# Server-Side of Our Project

Welcome to the server-side of our project! This project demonstrates the integration of a React frontend with a Node.js backend. It includes various functionalities to manage user data, such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting users.

## API Routes

- [GET /api/users: Retrieve a list of users.]s
- [POST /api/users: Create a new user.]
- [GET /api/users/:id: Retrieve a specific user by ID.]
- [PUT /api/users/:id: Update an existing user by ID.]
- [DELETE /api/users/:id: Delete a user by ID.]

These routes are implemented in the Node.js backend and are used to perform CRUD operations on user data.

## About the Project

This project showcases how to build a full-stack application using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The application provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the user data stored on the server.
